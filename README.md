    High availability server by terraform (Aws)
    
   

   ***The Bastion Host project is a Terraform-based solution that creates a high availability server infrastructure on AWS. This project utilizes Terraform to automate the provisioning and management of the infrastructure required for the Bastion Host.***
    
***A Bastion Host serves as a secure gateway for accessing and managing servers within a private network. It acts as a single point of entry and provides an additional layer of security by acting as a barrier between the internet and the private network.***

***The high availability aspect of the project ensures that the Bastion Host infrastructure is resilient and can handle failures without disruption. It typically involves deploying multiple instances across different availability zones to achieve redundancy and fault tolerance.***

***By deploying the Bastion Host infrastructure through Terraform, organizations can easily create and manage a secure access point to their private network. It simplifies the process of setting up and maintaining the infrastructure, reducing manual effort and increasing operational efficiency.***

***Overall, the Bastion Host project enables organizations to establish a secure and highly available server infrastructure for accessing and managing servers within a private network. It provides a robust and scalable solution for secure remote access, enhancing the overall security posture of the organization's infrastructure.***
